Prerequisites
-------------

To avoid any unexpected application behaviour, make sure you have installed the following tools with the proper version numbers:

- [Eclipse Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)
- [Maven 3.9.6](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

Running project locally
-----------------------

### Creating database secrets configuration file

Before you start, make sure you set up a MySQL database locally on your machine, then perform these steps:

1. Install [v4.25.3](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/v4.25.3) of [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) on your machine
2. Generate `database-secrets.yml` configuration file with this [shell script](./generate-database-secrets-file.sh)
3. Finally, provide your local database's secrets in place of `null` values

**Note that:**

- The `database-secrets.yml` configuration file is excluded from git tracking, not to accidentally committing secrets to the GitHub repository.
- For local development don't use the **default** Spring profile, it is configured with an H2 in-memory database for passing the Continuous integration GitHub check.

### Start application

```bash
mvn clean package

mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```
